# Weather Agent System

A multi-agent AI system for weather data analysis using Python.

## Description

This project demonstrates an agentic AI approach where multiple specialized agents work together to analyze weather data. Each agent has a specific responsibility:
- DateAgent: Manages date operations
- DataLoaderAgent: Handles data loading
- TemperatureAgent: Analyzes temperature data
- HumidityAgent: Processes humidity information
- WindAgent: Evaluates wind conditions
- WeatherSummaryAgent: Provides weather summaries
- VisibilityPressureAgent: Analyzes visibility and pressure data

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/salifshaikh/Weather-Report-System---Agentic-AI>
cd weather-agent-system
